# NanoDocs

## What is NanoDocs?

NanoDocs is a tool for generating online documentation.

You write your documentation in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format, and NanoDocs combines the files into a [single-page app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) that you can host wherever you like.

The [full documentation](https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/nanodocs-docs/) is a great example of what can be achieved with the default settings.

## Why a single-page app?

If your documentation exists as a collection of multiple web pages, users can't access it offline.

NanoDocs allows users to download your documentation (including images) as a single HTML file, which can be opened by any browser without the need for an internet connection.

## Look and feel

NanoDocs ships with multiple themes, each of which supports multiple colour modes and text resizing.

Take a look at some examples in the [themes](https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/nanodocs-docs/#usage+themes) guide.
