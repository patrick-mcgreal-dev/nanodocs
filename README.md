# NanoDocs

NanoDocs is a tool for generating online documentation.

You write your documentation in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format, and NanoDocs combines the files into a single HTML page that you can host wherever you like.

NanoDocs ships with several different themes to choose from, and also supports custom theming.

The [full documentation](#) - generated with NanoDocs - is a great example of what can be achieved with the default settings.
